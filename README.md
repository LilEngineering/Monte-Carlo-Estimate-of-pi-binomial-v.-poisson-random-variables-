# Monte-Carlo-Estimate-of-pi-binomial-v.-poisson-random-variables-
ECE 3077 Stats Code for HW 5 

first part is the iteration loop to approx. pi using the monte carlo estimate 

second part is a coding proving the mathematical fact that the binomial pmf can be very closely approximated by a poisson pmf when n is large and p is small
